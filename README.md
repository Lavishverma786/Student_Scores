## Key Findings

### Gender Distribution
- **Insight**: Female students outnumber male students in the dataset.
- **Analysis**: This insight provides an opportunity to analyze potential gender-based performance trends.

### Parent Education and Student Scores
- **Insight**: Students tend to score better when their parents have a higher level of education.
- **Analysis**: This suggests that parental education could positively influence students' academic performance.

### Parent Marital Status and Student Scores
- **Insight**: The marital status of parents has negligible or no impact on students' scores.
- **Analysis**: Academic performance appears to be independent of this factor.

### Sports Practice
- **Insight**: Students who practice sports regularly achieve better scores.
- **Analysis**: Highlights the importance of physical activity in enhancing academic performance.

### Ethnic Group Distribution
- **Insight**: Percentage distribution of students across ethnic groups was visualized.
- **Analysis**: This can provide insights into representation and inclusion in academic performance.

### Weekly Study Hours
- **Insight**: Weekly study hours (categorized as `< 5`, `5-10`, etc.) show a strong connection to scores.
- **Analysis**: More study hours tend to correlate with better performance.
